I do **NOT** use AI to make any of my content (Art, Code, Music, more) WHATSOEVER!!!!! 
The only thing I can't control is if the creator of dependencies I use used AI to help.

If you wanna clone and edit the code and tinker with it.. Go ahead! I wouldnt really 
recommend it at all because in the current state (and most likely future state) of the
website has horrible code, I honestly think it's some of my worst and I'm not proud of 
it at all.

September 2nd 2025:

With the current state of my website yeah i know the code is absolute dog water lol. 
Probably some of the worst ive made so far. But NOW I got the concept and layout. 
Ima try to make this code less bad... hopefully... Also for random commit changes
eh either just messing around or taking shit away thats not relavent. Like when i 
removed some social links, not because i wanna hide anything IDGAF just because im 
not active on those accounts at all. You can still look at old commits for that stuff
and i really dont care tbh its a public repo. I have a lot of plans for this website 
just need the motivation to actually do it lmao. I know there is a lot a lot a lot 
of issues with the website. Such as auto-containers looking like doo doo. I brainstormed 
a fix. Also on the topic of doo doo i know when you resize a window the scaling doesnt 
update. Hell theres hardly any scaling at all lol. Know i know how things should be laid down 
ill do proper scaling and less of this hardcoded bs. The issue is realtime scaling. Im using
p5.js which is really not lightweight and Probably not great for what im doing buttttt its 
what im used to... Also god damn i want to work on the warriors simulator so much more
:sad: Its a clusterfuck of code so far tbh. Well anyways if you actually read all my rambling
bs im very surprised you made it this far. Well anyways thanks I guess, and...

Have a lovely day~
