With the current state of my website yeah i know the code is absolute dog water lol. 
Probably some of the worst ive made so far. But NOW I got the concept and layout. 
Ima try to make this code less bad... hopefully... Also for random commit changes
eh either just messing around or taking shit away thats not relavent. You can still
look at old commits for that stuff and i really dont care tbh its a public repo. I have
a lot of plans for this website just need the motivation to actually do it lmao.
